<H3><A name="main">Main Screen</A></H3>
<P style="margin-right:30px;">
	<P>The main screen allows you to perform several functions.  You can <font color=#ff0000>Add a Note</font color> by touching the icon on the top right corner of the screen.</P>  

	<P>You can also navigate to any of the <font color=#ff0000>Rating Categories</font color> which include <font color=#4444ff>Anxiety, Depression, General Well-Being, Head Injury, Post-traumatic Stress, or Stress</font color>.</P>  

	<P>The <font color=#ff0000>Results</font color> area takes you to graph results which display all of your previous ratings, and allows you to <font color=#ff0000>view notes</font color> you have previously entered.</P>

	<P>The lower area of the screen provides <font color=#ff0000>information</font color> about T2 Mood Tracker, gives you with the opportunity to send written <font color=#ff0000>feedback</font color> about the app directly to the developers, and offers this <font color=#ff0000>help</font color> information.</P>  

	<P>The <font color=#ff0000>Settings</font color> area contains a <font color=#4444ff>Category Editor</font color> which allows you to hide any of the rating categories that may not interest to you.</P>
	 
	<P>You can also set a <font color=#4444ff>reminder</font color> so you don’t forget to make your ratings.  At any point you can <font color=#4444ff>clear</font color> all of your ratings from any of the categories and clear your notes as well.</P>

	<P>You can also enable <font color=#4444ff>security</font color> using a PIN and enable or disable the <font color=#4444ff>health tips</font color> on startup.</P> 

	<P>Knowing how T2 Mood Tracker is being used helps the developers to modify and upgrade the app based on <font color=#4444ff>anonymous usage</font color> patterns.  This information DOES NOT compromise your personal anonymity in any way.  You may disable this function if you choose, however.</P>

	<P>The last function on the list allows you to tell a friend about the app using an email message which includes download information.</P>

<H3><A name="rate">Rate Your Mood</A></H3>
<P style="margin-right:30px;">
	<P>By selecting the mood category you’d like to rate you will see a screen with ten opposing pairs of feeling states like happy-sad.  To rate how you are doing, move the slider with your finger to the place on the scale that best reflects how you are feeling at the moment.</P>

	<P>Make sure you rate yourself on each of the ten pairs of feelings by scrolling to the very bottom of the screen.  When you have completed your ratings, touch “save” and you will be returned to the main screen.  Your rating will be automatically included on the graph for that mood category.<P>

<H3><A name="review">Review Your Result Graphs</A></H3>
<P style="margin-right:30px;">
	<P>By selecting <font color=#ff0000>Graphed Results</font color> from the main screen you can view all of your ratings by date.  To view graphs of previous or subsequent months use the arrows beneath the graph.  You can view your results on any combination of mood categories by toggling each one ON or OFF.</P>
	
	<P>Each point on the graph represents the average of your mood ratings for each of the ten opposing pairs of feeling states for that mood category on a given day.  Data points toward the top of the graph represent higher levels of each mood category (high Anxiety, high General Well-Being) while ratings toward the bottom of the graph represent lower levels.

<P style="margin-right:30px;">
	<P>You can view your notes by touching <font color=#ff0000>Notes.</font color>  There is a small triangle shaped indicator on the top of the graph indicating which dates have notes associated with them.  You can add a note for any date by touching “<font color=#ff0000>Add a Note</font color>” at the top of the screen.</P>
	
	<P>By touching any of the Mood Category labels (e.g., Anxiety), you can display the graphs of your self-ratings for each of the ten pair of opposing feeling states.  As with the category graphs, you can display or hide each of the graphs by toggling them ON and OFF.</P>
	
	<P>You can <font color=#ff0000>clear your graphs</font color> by going to Settings > Clear Result Data</P>
